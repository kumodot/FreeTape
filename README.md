Simple online MP3 Player via Browser, that play Local files,  using P5js. Made with the help of Chat GPT. 

Version 58 - August 03
- New Tape Faceplate with a Touch of realism, paper texture, bolts, etc. 
- New Tape Animation. Now there's a tape at the botton that also moves along with the reels, and reacts to Play/Stop actions
- Stop now pauses the music. 
- Added a New Sound for the Play Button ! And a intro noise before each music starts with a delay. 
- Keyboard Shortcuts (My idea is to do a arduino mechanical controller) ! 
   P = Play 
   S = STOP
   F = FWD
   R = RWD
   B = Toggles the Magenta Background ! So you can use it on your Live Streams in OBS using the Color Key ! 
   U = Toggle the UI for a clean look and preparing for my project with mechanical buttons !
